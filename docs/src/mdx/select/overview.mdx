## Select

provides a capability to select one of the passed items.

### Usage

```js
import { Select } from 'oah-ui';
```

If you want to use it as the multi-select control you have to mark it as multiple. In this case, `Select` will work only with arrays - accept arrays and propagate arrays.

[Example](demo://Example.tsx)

There are four select sizes:

[Size](demo://Size.tsx)

And two additional style types - `outline`:

[Outline](demo://Outline.tsx)

and `hero`:

[Hero](demo://Hero.tsx)

Select is available in different shapes, that could be combined with the other properties:
